I'm currently a PhD student studying Computational Biology and Bioinformatics at Yale University. I enjoy crossing disciplines and learning how machine learning can improve our understanding of biomolecular structure and function.

### A Little About Me
 
Before graduate school, I interned at Genentech applying machine learning to internal chemical data for property prediction. 
I majored in Pharmacological Chemistry with a minor in Mathematics at UC San Diego, where I conducted research in the [Amaro Lab](https://amarolab.ucsd.edu/) and [Walker Lab](http://www.rosswalker.co.uk).
