<br/>
I'm currently a PhD student studying Computational Biology and Bioinformatics at Yale University. I am interested in the interface of chemistry, biology, and computer science. I am particularly interested in interdisciplinary and novel methods when it comes to the discovery and design of new therapeutics.

### What's New

- (06/19) I've joined the [Krishnaswamy Lab](https://www.krishnaswamylab.org/) at Yale

### A Little About Me

I'm interested in a lot of things but I spend most of my time at the intersection of mathematics, computer science, and biology. More specifically, I often focus the use of machine learning, mainly unsupervised methods, to elucidate underlying drivers in biological processes. 
 
During graduate school, I interned at Genentech applying machine learning to internal chemical data for property prediction. 
I also majored in Pharmacological Chemistry with a minor in Mathematics at UC San Diego, where I did research in the [Amaro Lab](https://amarolab.ucsd.edu/) and [Walker Lab](http://www.rosswalker.co.uk).
