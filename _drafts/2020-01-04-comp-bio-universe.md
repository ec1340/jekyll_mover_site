### A 100 foot perspective


<br/><br/>
Its very likely that you have seen articles or press releases describing the growing role of "AI" in biology and how it will revolutionalize how we discover or engineer various aspects of biology. If not I recommend a quick google search "AI" + \<your favorite biology term\>. 

While these articles bring a greater awareness to the exciting advances made by this mix of computer science and biology, they all possess the same inherent shortcoming. By their "general audience"-focused nature, those articles often take a 10k feet view of this phenomenon and remove much of the detail and reasoning involved in this field. This leaves the reader's *what* answered but the *how* still unresolved.

Research articles on the other hand dive too quickly into the weeds - only including one or two paragraphs describing machine learning's role in computational biology before delving into the technical aspects of their work*. The short introduction 3Page limit enforced by scientific journals and conferences make this issue unfortunately unavoidable. 

With this short blog post, I will provides a 100ft view. 

Since a comprehensive survey of machine learning in biology would be too long a read for a blog post, I will instead focus on a small but exciting part of the field, which is **unsupervised learning of molecular and macromolecular entities in biology**. In other words, the application of unsupervised machine learning to learn representations of objects like molecule or proteins.  

I'll talk about a few, hopefully informative examples of where machine learning can bring about new interpretations and insights of these entities which can in turn bring about the efficiencies claimed by the aformentioned articles and press releases.

" areas that can be improved"


- represenation learning
- measures of similarity/distance 
    - the above two are intertwined

- dimensionality reduction
- data quality/quantity
-
