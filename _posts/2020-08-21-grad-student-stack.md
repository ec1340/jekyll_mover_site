Since the start of grad school, I've realized that success depends heavily on time is used. With the flexibility granted in grad school and the many responsibilities you're likely to take on, it's easy to slip into time-sinks and misguided priorities. To help combat this, I made this list for myself to keep track of the various tools available that can help me be as productive and time-efficient as possible. 

The best advice in grad school I received so far was from a senior grad student before my first semester even began. It was to start early with planning how you want your ideal work-life to look like.  In other words, set your default day/week early.

This involves things like your work schedule, gym schedule, healthy eating habits, etc. The purpose of doing so is to set your "default" as early as possible so that when the inevitable crunch time comes around and throws off your schedule, you can quickly regain control after. Otherwise you take on a risk of gradually lowering the bar as to what your day looks like and allowing days to become chaotic and your actions, as a consequence, reactionary instead of proactive*.

- *The pivot from reactionary to more proactive scheduling of time is a key step from David Allen's Getting Things Done. I highly recommend this book.
